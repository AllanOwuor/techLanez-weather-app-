A weather app I made using OpenWeatherMap API in Vanilla JavaScript.

The app tells the current temperature and some additional information like Air Quality Index, Real Feel, Humidity, Highest Temperature, Lowest Temperature, Wind Speed, Wind Direction, Visibility, Pressure, Sunrise and Sunset.


## Configuration
To use the OpenWeatherMap API, you need to obtain an API key. Follow these steps to set up your API key:

* Go to the OpenWeatherMap website: https://openweathermap.org/
* Sign up for a free account or log in if you already have an account.
* Once logged in, go to your profile and navigate to the "API Keys" section.
* Generate a new API key and copy it.
* In the project directory, locate the script.js file. Inside this file, you will find a constant called API_KEY. Replace the placeholder value 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key obtained from OpenWeatherMap.

```
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
```
